# School Management System - Frontend
The frontend for school management system is built using react. And netlify is used to deploy the frotnend with react.
**Used Tools:**
 - Netlify
 - Git / Github
 - React
 
 Making the frontend as pwa skips the load time for users that have the app installed on their devices. And deploying it to netlify makes it faster to load because of edge serving
